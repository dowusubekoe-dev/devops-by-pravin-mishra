            <h2 id="learning-summary">Concepts You’ve Learned (Git & GitHub)</h2>

            <p><b>Briefly explain the Git & GitHub concepts you’ve learned so far (like repository basics, status,
                    staging, commits, history, branching, merging, etc.).</b></p>

            <p>
                ✦ Imagine you’re explaining these ideas to a 10th-grade student, so use <b>simple words</b> and
                <b>easy-to-understand examples or analogies</b>.
                <br>✦ Also, think like a <b>DevOps/Cloud engineer</b> – sometimes applications fail, and while you may
                not fix
                the app code itself, you need to <b>look into code snippets, logs, or commit history</b> to understand
                what went wrong.
                <br>✦ For example: a wrong database connection string in code will show up in logs, and using Git
                history you can
                check <i>who changed it</i> and <i>when</i>.
            </p>

            <p><b>Your Task:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Explain Git concepts in your own words (as if teaching someone new).</li>
                <li>Connect at least one Git concept with a real-world debugging scenario.
                    <small>(e.g., “If an application suddenly stops connecting to the database, I can use
                        <code>git log</code> to
                        see if someone recently changed the configuration file.”)</small>
                </li>
                <li>Write 8–10 lines in simple language, add screenshots if possible.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="placeholder">Git is like a time machine for code. All your project files live inside a repository
                (repo), which is like a big folder that tracks every change. When you type git status, it shows what’s
                new, what’s changed, and what’s ready to be saved. Before saving, you move files into a staging area
                with git add. Then you lock in the changes with a commit, which is like taking a snapshot of your
                project at that moment.<br>

                <br>With git log, you can scroll back through history and see who changed what and when. If you want to
                try out new ideas without breaking the main project, you create a branch. Later, when the idea works,
                you bring it back into the main project with a merge.<br>

                <br>In DevOps, this history is gold. Say an app suddenly can’t reach the database. I’d check the error
                logs and then use git log on the config file to see if someone recently changed the database connection
                string. That way I know when the mistake happened and who pushed it.<br>

                <br>So Git isn’t just about saving work, it’s also about teamwork, safety nets, and fast debugging when
                things break.<br>
