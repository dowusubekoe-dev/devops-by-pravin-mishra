# Introduction to Version Control

## 1. What is Version Control?

* **Version Control** is a system that manages different versions of files (e.g., code, documents).
* It keeps track of **changes over time**, allowing you to:

  * Collaborate with others.
  * View the history of changes.
  * Restore older versions if needed.

## 2. Understanding "Versions"

* A **version** is simply a new state of something after changes.
* **Examples:**

  * **Books**: A 2nd edition of a book with extra chapters is a new version.
  * **Apps**: Frequent WhatsApp updates (v2.21, v2.22, etc.) are versions with fixes/features.

## 3. Why Version Control?

* Helps **multiple developers work together** on the same project without overwriting each otherâ€™s work.
* Provides a **history of changes** (who made changes, what changed, when).
* Makes it possible to **revert to previous versions** if mistakes occur.
* Ensures the **safety of original code** by maintaining structured versions.

## 4. What is Git?

* **Git** = A **Version Control System (VCS)**.
* Also called a **Source Code Management System (SCM)**.
* With Git, developers can:

  * Track changes in code.
  * Create and manage multiple versions.
  * Work collaboratively without disturbing othersâ€™ code.

## 1. Git Provides Version Control

* **Version Control** = ability to track and manage changes in your code.
* Example:

  * When editing a document, you can **undo** changes to go back to an earlier version.
  * Git does the same for your code: it saves versions so you can **revert anytime**.
* ðŸ”‘ Benefit: If you make a mistake, you donâ€™t have to start overâ€”you can restore a previous version.

## 2. Git Supports Branching

* **Branching** = creating a **separate copy of code** to work independently from the main code.
* Each branch is isolated, meaning you can **experiment without risk**.
* Example:

  * You want to add a new feature to your website.
  * Instead of changing the main code directly, you create a **branch**, add and test your feature there.
  * Once ready, you merge it back into the main code.
* ðŸ”‘ Benefit: Safe experimentation and development of new features without breaking the original project.

---

## 3. Git Allows Merging

* **Merging** = combining changes from two branches into one unified version.
* Example:

  * You finish coding a feature in your branch.
  * Using **merge**, your changes are added to the **main branch**.
* ðŸ”‘ Benefit: Enables developers to work on different features simultaneously and later combine their work without losing changes.

---

## 4. Git Enables Collaboration

* **Collaboration** = multiple developers, stakeholders, and team members working on the same project.
* With Git:

  * Each team member can work on different parts of the code **at the same time**.
  * Git ensures changes donâ€™t overwrite each other.
  * Team members can see updates, give feedback, and build together.
* ðŸ”‘ Benefit: Makes teamwork efficient, reduces conflicts, and keeps everyone aligned.
