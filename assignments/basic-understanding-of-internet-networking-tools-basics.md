# Important Guidelines for Submissions

- `**All screenshots must clearly show your own computer or environment**`. Do not copy screenshots from other students or the internet.
- All tasks should be completed individually.

## Task 1: Using ChatGPT as Your Learning Assistant

**Scenario:**

You’re new to DevOps and will frequently encounter technical questions. ChatGPT can be your learning companion.

**Your Task:**

- Clearly write a ChatGPT prompt to help you understand the following concept:

      `**“What is a protocol in networking? Explain with a simple real-life example.”**`

- Take a screenshot of your interaction clearly showing:
        - Your detailed prompt (setting clear expectations).
        - ChatGPT's simplified response with an example.

## Task 2: Internet and Networking

**Scenario:**

Your friend is launching an online bookstore named "EpicReads." He asked you to explain how users globally can access his website hosted in Finland.

**Your Task:**

- Write a short explanation (around 100-150 words), mentioning clearly:
        - How someone from the USA accesses a website hosted in Finland.
        - Clearly include and explain:

            - Packet Switching
            - IP Address
            - TCP/IP
            - HTTP/HTTPS

**`**Tip**`: Use ChatGPT as demonstrated in Task 1 if you need help.

## Task 3: Application Architecture & Stack

**Scenario:**

EpicReads bookstore has two app versions:

        - Two-tier app (Frontend & Database)
        - Three-tier app (Frontend, Backend & Database)

**Your Task:**

- Draw simple diagrams clearly showing both architectures (hand-drawn or using tools like draw.io).
- Label each layer clearly: Frontend, Backend, Database.
- List at least `**two common technologies or tools**` used for each layer in both architectures.

`**Tip**`: Take a photo or screenshot clearly showing it’s your own drawing.

## Task 4: Domain Name & DNS (Basic Concepts)

**Scenario:**

Your friend’s bookstore, EpicReads, is accessible via an IP address (`**52.172.142.222**`) at port `**3000**`. He purchased the domain `**epicreads.com**`.

**Your Task:**

- Briefly explain (in your own words, 50-100 words max):

        - What DNS (Domain Name System) is.
        - Which DNS record type your friend should use to connect his domain to the given IP address, and why.

(Detailed step-by-step DNS setup is not required at this stage.)

## Task 5: Visual Studio Code Setup (Hands-on)

Your Task:

    Install Visual Studio Code (if not already installed).

    Take a clear screenshot of your own VS Code environment showing:

        Terminal open within VS Code, clearly running a basic command (e.g., pwd, dir, or ls).

        Your selected VS Code theme clearly visible.

Important: Your screenshot must clearly show your username or identifiable detail to confirm it’s your environment.

## Task 6: Publish Your Assignment as a LinkedIn Post

**Objective:**

Publishing your assignments on LinkedIn helps build your professional online presence, reinforces your learning, and documents your DevOps journey publicly.

**Your Task:**

- Summarize and publish your completed answers from Tasks 1–5 clearly as a LinkedIn post.
- Clearly structure your post into sections (ChatGPT, Internet & Networking, App Architecture, DNS, VS Code setup).
- At the end of your post, clearly include this credit note with the provided links:

P.S. This post is part of the FREE DevOps for Beginners Cohort run by Pravin Mishra. You can start your DevOps journey for free from his YouTube Playlist.

- Include the link of your published LinkedIn post in your assignment submission document.
