# Create AWS Free Tier Account

1. What is an AWS account, and why is it important in DevOps?
This is an individual or company's entry point to Amazon Web Services via an AWS account. All of individual or company's cloud resources, billing, permissions, and settings are stored in what functions as a container. It's crucial to DevOps because it offers a safe, regulated setting where groups can create, test, and launch applications with integrated automation, scalability, and collaboration.

2. What is the AWS Free Tier, and how long does it last?
Through the AWS Free Tier program, new users can investigate and test out AWS services without having to pay right away. Some services (such specific monitoring or IAM functions) are always free for the first 12 months after you create your account, while others have usage limitations during that time.

3. Name three AWS services included in the Free Tier and specify how much usage is available for free.

- `**Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**`: 750 hours per month of t2.micro or t3.micro instances.
- `**Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**`: 5 GB of standard storage, 20,000 GET requests, and 2,000 PUT requests each month.
- `**Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**`: 750 hours per month of db.t2.micro or db.t3.micro instance usage, plus 20 GB of storage.
