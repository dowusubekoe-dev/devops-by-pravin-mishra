# Guidelines for Asking Questions Effectively

To ensure you receive the most effective support from us and to develop your problem-solving skills, please follow this structured approach when asking questions.

## 1. Understanding the Problem and Error

    - Clearly explain the error you are encountering.
    - Demonstrate your understanding of the problem instead of just copying and pasting an error message.
    - Why this is important:

        - Understanding the problem is 50% of the solution.
        - Avoid blindly following steps; instead, take the time to understand the issue thoroughly.

    - Before asking a question, ask yourself:

        - Have I truly understood what the error message means?
        - Can I explain the problem in my own words?

## 2. Documenting Steps Taken

    - List the steps you've already tried to resolve the issue.
    - Attempt at least two alternate solutions before reaching out.
    - Search for solutions on forums, documentation, and online resources.
    - Explain why you think your attempts didn’t work.

Example:

        `Attempt 1: I tried clearing the cache, but the error persisted.

        Attempt 2: I updated the dependency version, but it caused another issue.
        `

## 3. Encouraging the Use of AI Tools

    - Utilize AI tools such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, or Amazon Q to troubleshoot the issue.
    - Document the AI prompts used and their responses.

Example:

    `I asked ChatGPT: "How to resolve AWS Lambda timeout errors?"
     
    Response: It suggested increasing the timeout duration in the AWS console, which I tried, but it didn’t fully resolve the issue.
    `
