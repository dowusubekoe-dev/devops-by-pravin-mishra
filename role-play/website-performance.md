# Website Performance

## Why customers might be experiencing slow access

Think of the EpicReads website like an international package delivery service:

* **Distance matters** – If our main servers are in one location (say, the US), customers in Asia or Africa might have to “wait longer” for data to travel across the internet.
* **Traffic jams online** – Just like highways, internet routes can get congested, slowing delivery.
* **Lookups taking too long** – Before customers reach our site, their browsers have to “look up” our address through something called DNS. If that lookup is slow, the whole process slows down.
* **Website structure** – If our site has a lot of large images or runs many background tasks, it takes longer for pages to load, especially on slower connections.

## 2. Key concepts in plain English

* **DNS (Domain Name System)**
  Like a phone book for the internet. You type `epicreads.com`, DNS finds the right “phone number” (IP address) for our server. If the phone book is slow or outdated, the call takes longer to connect.

* **IP address**
  This is the unique “street address” of our server. Without it, the internet doesn’t know where to send the request.

* **Networking protocols (like HTTP/HTTPS)**
  These are the “rules of the road” for how browsers and servers talk to each other. Faster, more modern protocols can improve load times.

* **Architecture tiers**
  Our site might have layers like:

  * **Frontend** – what customers see in the browser.
  * **Backend** – where the business logic runs.
  * **Database** – where our book and order information lives.
    If any layer is slow, the whole experience slows down.

## 3. Initial steps to troubleshoot & improve performance

1. **Measure load times** from different parts of the world to see where delays happen.
2. **Check DNS speed** and ensure we use a fast, reliable provider.
3. **Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN)** so customers get content from a server near them.
4. **Optimize site content** – compress images, reduce heavy scripts.
5. **Review server performance** – ensure backend and database aren’t overloaded.
6. **Monitor network routes** – detect and fix slow internet paths.

`nslookup epicreads.com`

Server:  2603-9000-ca02-67f1-0000-0000-0000-0001.inf6.spectrum.com
Address:  2603:9000:ca02:67f1::1

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    epicreads.com
Addresses:  104.18.18.147
          104.18.19.147
The browser first resolves the website's domain name to an IP address through the Domain Name System (DNS). Think of DNS as an online phonebook for matching domain names to their server addresses. After this, the browser communicates with the server using HTTP or HTTPS to fetch the content. So, good explanation overall! Now, can you explain why global customers might experience delays in retrieving data from our web server?

Two-tier architecture → The app has just two main parts:
User interface (what people see and use — e.g., website or app)
Database (where the data is stored)
The user interface talks directly to the database.

Three-tier architecture → The app has an extra middle layer:
User interface (frontend)
Application logic (backend — handles rules, processing, security)
Database (storage)
The user interface talks to the backend, and the backend talks to the database.

## **1. Learn in Small, Focused Chunks**

Instead of asking “Teach me DevOps,” break your learning into topics:

* **Tools** → “Explain Docker in simple terms with examples.”
* **Processes** → “What is CI/CD and why is it important in DevOps?”
* **Practices** → “Walk me through setting up automated testing in a CI/CD pipeline.”
* **Culture** → “What does ‘Shift Left’ mean in DevOps?”

💡 *Ask for explanations in plain English first, then request technical depth when you feel ready.*

---

## **2. Use It for Practical, Hands-on Learning**

* “Give me a step-by-step guide to deploy a sample web app using Docker and Kubernetes.”
* “Generate a small Jenkins pipeline script that builds and tests a Python project.”
* “Show me Terraform code to launch an EC2 instance in AWS.”
* “Give me realistic troubleshooting scenarios for a failed CI build.”

💡 *Run the code or steps yourself in your lab environment to turn theory into skill.*

---

## **3. Clear Up Doubts Instantly**

Whenever you’re stuck:

* Copy/paste **just the error message** (no secrets!) → “Explain this error and possible fixes.”
* Describe the situation → “My Ansible playbook fails to connect to the host. Here’s the error — what should I check first?”
* Ask for comparisons → “What’s the difference between GitHub Actions and Jenkins for CI/CD?”

---

## **4. Practice Troubleshooting Like a Real Engineer**

Give ChatGPT the role of “senior engineer” and yourself as “junior” (like we just did with the EpicReads downtime scenario).

* Ask it to quiz you on diagnosing network issues, broken pipelines, or deployment failures.
* Have it give hints only when you’re stuck, so you build problem-solving skills.

---

## **5. Use It to Build Your DevOps Portfolio**

* “Suggest beginner-friendly DevOps projects to put on GitHub.”
* “Help me write documentation for a sample CI/CD pipeline I built.”
* “Create a short, clear README for my Dockerized app.”

---

💡 **Pro tip:** Always follow a cycle → **Ask → Try it yourself → Ask again for review**. This way, ChatGPT becomes a feedback loop, not just a knowledge dump.
