Git Commands
================

git init – Creates a new Git repository in your folder. Think of it as turning on “version tracking” for that project.

git status – Shows what’s going on. You’ll see which files are new, changed, or already staged for commit.

git add . – Moves all changed files into the “staging area,” which means they’re ready to be saved in the next snapshot.

git commit -m "message" – Saves a snapshot of your project with a short note (the message) describing what you changed.

git log – Lists all commits in detail (who made them, when, and the commit message).

git log --oneline – A shorter version of git log that shows each commit as a single line, which is easier to scan quickly.
